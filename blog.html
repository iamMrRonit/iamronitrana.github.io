                        Technology and human life are inseparable; they are co-dependent on each other so much so that one can’t co-exist without other. For e.g. Every complexity that humans have to face in their day to day activities is eased off significantly with the help of technologies so to maintain our quality of life we have immense dependency on technologies which may vary from work to work to get the desired effect and in the other hand we have technology which only exist because of the combined thoughts and ideas put behind it by the humans to create something to ease their day to day burden. <br>
                        <br>We use technology because our daily life demands it and it isn’t <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">necessarily a bad thing as the sole purpose of it’s creation was to ease of our load but some may oppose and debate it, Not because we are over using it but for how it’s been poorly applicated which results in environmental pollution that leads to degradation in nature, health and creates a foul atmosphere. With Elon Musk and his well renowned company Tesla which is replacing fuel usage with electricity and batteries in the hope of reducing the environment pollution further. Even though it seems like it could take ages to replace fuel with electricity for the fact that the demands for fuel are up rising more than ever, but its safe to say that the problem of fuel usages which is having a bad effect on  the earth has been acknowledged globally and a lot  of countries are willing to reduce their over reliance on these harmful sources of energy by depending more in natural energies, which we can all agree is a step in a right direction. Now that the foundation has been created, we can hopefully see rapid changes in replacing fossil fuels or at least see its reduced usage globally. </span><button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read more</button>
